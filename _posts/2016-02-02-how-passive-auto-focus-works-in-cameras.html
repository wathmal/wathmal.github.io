<p style="text-align: justify;">did you ever wonder how your smartphone manage to focus on any place you tap on the camera app? :) okey, even if u did or didn't now you gonna find how.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">to&nbsp;achieve the correct focus, modern digital cameras have come up with 3 approaches such as, <strong>ACTIVE, PASSIVE and HYBRID</strong>. in <strong>ACTIVE</strong> approach they use separate sensor mechanism to detect focus. in <strong>PASSIVE</strong> approach, it uses algorithmic ways to find correct focus from the input of the optical system. there are few&nbsp;ways doing this, i'm gonna show you, how it is done with "<em><strong>contrast detection</strong></em>" method.</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">so let's jump into some facts. ;)</p>
<p><strong>when a region is at its sharpest focus, the adjacent pixels in the region will be at maximum contrast.</strong> in another word difference between intensity levels in the region is higher than the differences between intensity levels in the region, when the region is not focused.</p>
<p>what will happen to the image mean when it is focused or blurred? so let us take a sample image, make it blur and calculate the mean of those two. i blurred the image using gimp (gaussian blur radius 10px) and calculated image statics using <code>imagemagic</code>.</p>

<p><code>identify -verbose independent-arcade-lightings.jpg</code>&nbsp;command will pull out all image statistics of you image.</p>
<p>as you can see,&nbsp;<em>mean of the both original and blurred images is same.</em> :) so image mean does not affect with the focus of the image. also, you can see that <em>standard deviation is the variable which has changed with the blurring. </em>an image's standard deviation is directly related to its contrast. (<em>standard deviation expresses by how much the members of a group differ from the mean value for the group</em>)</p>
<p>so we can conclude 2 facts about <strong>focus</strong>.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>focus does not affect image mean.</li>
<li>the spread of the pixel intensities (standard deviation) is affected by focusing.</li>
</ol>
<p>now we have a great way to measure if a region is focused or not. what we want to do is to implement <em><strong>a mechanical control system for the camera lens to achieve the highest possible contrast of the region</strong></em>. and that is what actually comes with PASSIVE AF digital cameras. the system can be modeled like below.</p>
